- hapi has a debug mode, which is a pain-free way to have your log events printed to the console,
- without configuring additional plugins or writing logging code yourself.

- By default, the only errors debug mode will print to console are uncaught errors in user code,
- and runtime errors from incorrect implementation of hapi's API.
- You can configure your server to print request events based on tag,
- however. For example, if you wanted to print any error in a request you would configure your server as follows:

	const server = Hapi.server({ debug: { request: ['error'] } });
