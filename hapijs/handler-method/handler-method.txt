- The handler option is a function that accepts two parameters, request, and h.
- The request parameter is an object with details about the end user's request,
- such as path parameters, an associated payload, authentication information, headers, etc.


- The second parameter, h, is the response toolkit,
- h is an object with several methods used to respond to the request.
- As you've seen in the previous examples, if you wish to respond to a request with some value,
- you simply return it from the handler.
- The payload may be a string, a buffer, a JSON serializable object, a stream or a promise.


- Alternatively you may pass the same value to h.
- response(value) and return that from the handler.
- The result of this call is a response object,
- that can be chained with additional methods to alter the response before it is sent.
- For example h.response('created').code(201) will send a payload of created with an HTTP status code of 201.
- You may also set headers, content type, content length, send a redirection response,
- and many other things that are documented in the API reference.
